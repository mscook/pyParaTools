SUMMARY:
-------
pyParaTools is a python module developed to work with paramagnetic nuclear
magnetic (NMR) observables in a more friendly manner.

The current version supports Pseudocontact shifts (PCS) Paramagnetic
Relaxation enhancement and Residual Dipolar Couplings.

pyParaTools provides a datastore for such assigned experimental data. It
can be used to calculate the expected expermintally determined values
from known/assumed parameters. It can be used to determine parameters
using non-linear least square fitting. Additional functions include
data exploration and utilities.

pyParaTools is easily extended. We ask that all modifications to pyParaTools
respect the licencing conditions. We would also like to hear how pyParaTools
has been used/modified.
